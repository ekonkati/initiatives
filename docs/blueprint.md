## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) to convey professionalism and focus. This saturated, somewhat vibrant color works well against a lighter background.
- Background color: Light Gray (#EEEEEE), providing a neutral and clean backdrop that ensures readability and reduces visual fatigue.
- Accent color: Violet (#9C27B0), an analogous color that can draw the user's attention to important calls to action and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif, for a modern, machined and neutral look appropriate for an organization.
- Use a consistent set of icons from a library like Material Design Icons to represent different initiative categories, statuses, and actions.
- Implement a responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Use subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and enhance the user experience, such as loading spinners, expanding details, and smooth scrolling.
